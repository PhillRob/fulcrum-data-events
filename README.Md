# Fulcrum Data Events
This is a list of `js` files that control data events in [fulcrumapp.com](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/). 

Files with uppercase abbreviations are project specific:
- DQ (tree, issue)
- OSM AMN (asset)
- WS (irrigation, construction, tree)
- WH (tree, issue)
- ~~KFR (tree, issue)~~
- KAR (tree, ~~issue)~~
- THM (issue, ~~elements)~~
- G20 tree assessment
- BRT (CBS Snagging, Streetscape v1.5) including data events for station lookup

Files with lower case file names provide general solutions based on the [fulcrum documentation](https://developer.fulcrumapp.com/data-events/examples/).
