# Fulcrum Data Events
This is a list of all js files that control data event in [fulcrumapp.com](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/). 

Files with uppercase abbreviations are project specific:
- DQ (tree, issue)
- OSM
- WS (irrigation, construction, tree)
- WH (tree, issue)
- ~~KFR (tree, issue)~~
- ~~KAR (tree, issue)~~
- THM (issue, ~~elements)~~

Files with lower case file names provide general solutions based on the [fulcrum documentation](https://developer.fulcrumapp.com/data-events/examples/).
